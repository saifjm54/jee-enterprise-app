 A hands-on enterprise project! ðŸš€ 
 Youâ€™re aiming to build a JEE Enterprise Application in Docker, using Continuous Delivery (CD), a well-structured deployment pipeline, and following Test-Driven Development (TDD).

 Hereâ€™s a detailed **step-by-step** roadmap to achieve this.

 | Step | Task |
| --- | --- |
|**1**| Setup project repository |
|**2**| Implement application using TDD |
|**3**| Dockerize the application |
|**4**| Setup CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins/GitHub Actions |
|**5**| Deploy using Kubernetes |
|**6**| Implement application using TDD |

# âœ… Final Outcome # 
  1. **Enterprise-grade JEE application** with authentication, order processing, and product management.
  2. **Dockerized deployment** ensures consistency across environments.
  3. **CI/CD pipeline** automates builds, tests, and deployments.
  4. **Kubernetes deployment** for scalability.
  5. **Test-driven development (TDD)** ensures code quality.
  6. **Monitoring with Prometheus & ELK** improves observability.
